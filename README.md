 <li>(a) Find out the peak transconductance (g<sub>m</sub>) for the MOSFET (TSMC Spice Model shared with you) at V<sub>DS</sub> = 5 V. (Use SPICE)

  <ul>

   <li>What is the corresponding V<sub>GS</sub> for the same? (Using SPICE)</li>

   <li>Find out the intrinsic output resistance (r<sub>0</sub>) for the same MOSFET for V<sub>GS</sub> found in (b). (Use SPICE) (d) Draw the small signal equivalent circuit for the MOSFET when V<sub>DS</sub> = 3 V and V<sub>GS</sub> found above. (e) Analytically design a regular class-A amplifier (without blocking and de-coupling capacitor) using the small signal equivalent circuit derived in (c) for an open circuit voltage gain of A<em><sub>v</sub></em> = 2. Find out all the parameters for the circuit e.g. V<sub>DD</sub>, V<sub>GG</sub>, R Find out the output impedance of the amplifier w/ and w/o R<sub>D</sub>.</li>

   <li>Re-design the same circuit in (d) using a single source V<sub>DD</sub> = 5 V and using R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>2</sub> potential divider network. Assuming the input blocking capacitance in infinite (C<sub>B</sub> = ∞).</li>

   <li>Find out the gain for the amplifier at 1 MHz and 1mHz in (e) if an additional load resistance R<sub>L</sub> = 10 kΩ is connected at the output with a decoupling capacitor of 1 μ</li>

 <li>Assume k’ = 2 mA/V<sup>2</sup>, V<sub>DD</sub> = 15 V and λ = 0.01 V<sup>-1</sup>.</li>

<ul>

 <li>Design a CS amplifier along with biasing circuit for gain -10 with minimum allowed output impedance. You can choose an appropriate biasing circuit based on your requirement.</li>

 <li>Design a CD amplifier along with biasing circuit such that the gain is 0.9 and minimum allowed output impedance. You can choose an appropriate biasing circuit based on your requirement.</li>

 <li>Design a CG amplifier with current gain 0.8 with maximum output impedance. You can choose an appropriate biasing circuit based on your requirement.</li>
